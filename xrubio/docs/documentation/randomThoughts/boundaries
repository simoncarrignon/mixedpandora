Every simulation is executed in a World of a given size. This is specified in the Simulation instance used to configure World.
To ask about the legal boundaries of World the getBoundaries method is used. Its value depends on the type of Scheduler, as World acts as a Bridge and asks Scheduler for this Rectangle.
For sequential schedulers it will go from (0,0) to (size._x, size._y), so it is expressed as global coordinates.
For spatial schedulers the _boundaries of a World are related to its position inside the whole simulation. For example, if a squared simulation of size=20 is executed in 4 computer nodes with an overlap between them of 2 the method will return:

node 0: from (0,0) to (12,12). This is the top left area of the world size + overlap
node 1: from (8,0) to (19,12). Top right area
node 2: from (0,8) to (12, 19). Bottom left area
node 3: from (8,8) tp (19,19). Botto right area

Internally the Scheduler also keeps track of _ownedArea, which is the zone controlled by every node (i.e. without buffers). Following this example _ownedArea would be:
node 0: from (0,0) to (9,9)
node 1: from (10,0) to (19,9)
node 2: from (0,10) to (9,19)
node 3: from (10,10) tp (19,19)
