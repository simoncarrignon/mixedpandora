This test checks if Raster Serialization is done properly.
By the end of the simulation every cell must contain a value equal to the multiplication of its coordinates (x*y).
It proofs that dynamic rasters are correctly serialized both using sequential and parallel schedulers.
It stores the results in two different folders (parallel and single) that should contain exactly the same progression of raster cell value increases
