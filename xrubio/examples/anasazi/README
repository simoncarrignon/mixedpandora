This code is a Pandora version of the classical Virtual Anasazi model. It is based on the data, code and ODD published by Marco Janssen's version on Netlogo.
Original version can be found at: http://www.openabm.org/model/2222/version/2/view
The code uses pyPandora to implement the ODD, as the original code do not implement some of the checks explained in the ODD to find locations for farms and settlements.
